# Reliability Diagram Block (RBD) Simulation in Maple

This project calculates the **Reliability** of a given system using **Reliability Diagram Block (RBD)** in Maple. It utilizes Maple's symbolic computation to analyze and evaluate system reliability based on the provided configuration.

## Features
- Calculates system reliability using RBD methodology.
- Supports complex systems with series, parallel, and combined configurations.

## Files
- **rbd.mw**: The main Maple worksheet for calculating system reliability.
- **rbd.txt**: System's spesification which is used as an input file.
- **backups_and_old_versions**: Contains backups and previous versions of the files.
- **LICENSE**: License information for the project.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need:
- Maple (for opening and running the `.mw` file)

## Usage
- Open `rbd.mw` in Maple.
- Load the system configuration from the input file.
- Run the worksheet to calculate and visualize the system's reliability.
- Adjust parameters or configurations as needed to explore different scenarios.

## License
This project is licensed under the terms specified in the `LICENSE` file.

## Contribution
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.
